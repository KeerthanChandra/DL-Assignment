# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with MNIST Dataset

This repository contains an example of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation using the MNIST dataset. CNNs are powerful tools in the field of computer vision, capable of learning hierarchical representations from structured data.

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks leverage convolutional layers, which are essential for filtering and feature extraction. These layers apply learnable filters to input data, capturing local patterns and spatial relationships. In this example, we demonstrate the application of CNNs to the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- keras

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhargav6031/DL-Assignment-7thsem.git
cd mnist-cnn
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the "mnist_cnn_example.ipynb" notebook and execute each cell to see the step-by-step process of implementing the CNN on the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used in this example and is included in the repository. It is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

## Implementation Steps

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load and explore the MNIST dataset.
3. Preprocess the data, including normalization and reshaping.
4. Split the data into training and validation sets.
5. Define the CNN model architecture.
6. Compile the model.
7. Augment the training data to improve model generalization.
8. Train the model.
9. Evaluate the model on the validation data.
10. Plot the training and validation accuracy over epochs.
11. Visualize model predictions on a subset of validation data.
12. Prepare and submit predictions for the test set.

Feel free to modify the notebook to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, or datasets.
